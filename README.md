Liri node app

This is a back-end node.js app, and for it to work you will need to download your own packages (moment, node-spotify-api, axios) into the same folder as liri.js. You will also need to install your own .env file with a spotify ID and "secret".

Once you do, you will be able to enter certain commands into your terminal/command line and receive data back on concerts, songs, and movies!

"concert-this" + artist name  ---- will return the upcoming concerts for that artist

"movie-this" + movie title --- will return data on the movie entered

"spotify-this-song" + track title  --- will return a search of spotify tracks similar to that song plus data

"do-what-it-says" ---- will spotify search the Backstreet Boys song "I Want it That Way" as read from random.txt!
